TODO:

- zustand from Pneuma
- mobile onconfirm from pneuma
- Basic admin portal from Rheumote (complex use) / Pneuma (simple architecture)
- Ability to add groups and members
- Subscriptions for groups - need to think through the architecture

NOTES:

- nextjs middleware can cause a lot of problems with dotenv-vault: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/39705
- expo dev client: add the expo-dev-client package to enable native packages
